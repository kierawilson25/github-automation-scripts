# Automation Scripts

A growing collection of Python scripts and automation tools I've built to solve common development workflow challenges.

## Scripts
- github issue creator script: This script allows the user to upload a JSON file of the issues they want to create and it will make them in the designated project.

### GitHub Issue Creator
Bulk create GitHub issues from a JSON file using the GitHub API. Perfect for setting up project milestones with multiple related tasks.


## Coming Soon
More automation tools for development workflows, data processing, and productivity.

## About
These scripts are tools I've built while working on various projects. Each script includes its own README with setup instructions and usage examples.
