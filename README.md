# Automation Scripts

Hi! 👋

Welcome to my collection of automation scripts. These are tools I've created to streamline my own development workflows, and I'm sharing them here in case they're helpful for you too.

## What's Inside

- **Bulk Issue Creator**
    - I needed to create a bunch of GitHub issues for a project migration and didn't want to do it manually, so I wrote this script. Define your issues in a JSON file, run the script, and they'll all be created in your repository. You can also assign them to milestones, add labels, and set assignees.
   - [View documentation →](Bulk%20Issue%20Creator/README.md)

## Coming Soon
I'm constantly finding new processes to automate! Expect more scripts for development workflows, data processing, and general productivity improvements.

## Using These Scripts

Each script has its own folder with a detailed README that includes:
- What the script does
- Setup instructions
- Usage examples
- Configuration options

Feel free to use any of these scripts for your own needs!
